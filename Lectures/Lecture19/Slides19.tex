\begin{frame}{Fitting a Line}
Linear relationship (with some error):
$$ Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X + u  $$

Taking the conditional expectation:
$$ E(Y | X) =  \beta_0 + \beta_1 X + E(u | X)  $$

With $E(u | X)=0$, 
$$ E(Y | X) =  \beta_0 + \beta_1 X   $$

OLS fits a linear line between average $Y$ at each $X$ and $X$.

\begin{frame}{Dummy Variables}
What if the independent variable is a binary variable that takes two values 1 and 0?  
$$ Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 D + u  $$ \\~\\
Taking conditional expectation (assuming exogeneity):
\begin{align*}
	E[Y | D=1] &= \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot 1  = \beta_0 + \red{\beta_1} \\
	E[Y | D=0] &= \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot 0 = \beta_0 
\end{align*}
So, $$\red{\beta_1} = E[Y | D=1]-E[Y | D=0] $$

%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Dummy Variables: Interpretation}
As before, to interpret $\beta_1$ as the causal impact of gender on wages, we need: $$E(u|female)=0$$ \\~\\
Meaning that omitted factors that impact wages are uncorrelated with gender, which implies:
$$\beta_1 = E[wages | female=1]-E[wages | female=0] $$ \\~\\

However, even if exogeneity doesn't hold, $\hat{\beta}_1$ still captures the difference in average wages of men and women in our sample.  
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Dummy Variables in Multiple Regression}
$$ Wages = \beta_0 + \beta_1 Age + \beta_2 Female +  u  $$ \\~\\
Taking conditional expectation (assuming exogeneity):
\begin{align*}
	E[Wages | Age, Female=1] &= (\beta_0+\red{\beta_2}) + \beta_1 Age
 \\
	E[Wages | Age, Female=0] &= \beta_0 + \beta_1 Age
	\end{align*} \\~\\
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Interaction Terms}
We can also include interaction terms in our model as follows:
$$ Wages = \beta_0 + \beta_1 Age + \beta_2 Female + \beta_3 Female \times Age +  u  $$ \\~\\
Taking conditional expectation (assuming exogeneity):
\begin{align*}
	E[Wages | Age, Female=1] &= (\beta_0+\red{\beta_2}) + (\beta_1+\red{\beta_3}) Age
 \\
	E[Wages | Age, Female=0] &= \beta_0 + \beta_1 Age
	\end{align*} \\~\\
Now the impact of $X$ on $Y$ varies with $D$.

\vspace{-1em}
$$ wages = \beta_0 + \beta_1 Female + \beta_2 Hispanic + \beta_3 Female \times Hispanic +  u  $$ \\~\\
Average wages for Non-Hispanic Males:
$$ E(wages|Hispanic=0, Female=0) = \beta_0  $$ 
Average wages for Non-Hispanic Females:
$$ E(wages|Hispanic=0, Female=1) = \beta_0 + \red{\beta_1}  $$
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Interaction of Two Dummy Variables}
\vspace{-1em}
$$ wages = \beta_0 + \beta_1 Female + \beta_2 Hispanic + \beta_3 Female \times Hispanic +  u  $$ \\~\\
Average wages for Hispanic Males:
$$ E(wages|Hispanic=1, Female=0) = \beta_0 + \beta_2  $$ 
Average wages for Hispanic Females:
$$ E(wages|Hispanic=1, Female=1) = \beta_0 + \red{\beta_1} + \beta_2 + \red{\beta_3}  $$

\begin{frame}{Variable with Multiple Categories}
	Five education categories:
	 $$ \{\text{Less than HS, HS Grad, Some College, College Degree, >College} \} $$ \\~\\
	 Add four dummy variables to the regression (why not five?):
	 $$ wages = \beta_0 + \beta_1 HS + \beta_2 SomeCol + \beta_3 Col + \beta_4 MoreThanCol +  u  $$ \\~\\
	 Reference category: Less than HS \\~\\
	 Coefficients capture the difference between average wages for that category and average wages for \textit{less than HS}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Binary Dependent Variable}
What if we have a binary variable on the left-hand side?

$$ emp = \beta_0 + \beta_1 educ  + u  $$

$$ E[emp|educ] = \beta_0 + \beta_1 educ    $$

Note that, 
$$ E[emp|educ] = P(emp=1|educ) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 educ $$ 

So, $\beta_1$ can be interpreted as the change in the probability of being employed. This is called the Linear Probability Model.

\begin{frame}{What's next?}
\begin{witemize}
  \item Next week, on Tuesday (11/07), we will continue with the linear regression model
  \item \textbf{No class on Thursday} (11/09) as I am traveling for a conference. Use this time to review the linear regression model and work on Problem Set 4.
  \item Problem Set 4 is due on the following Tuesday (11/14)
  \item The week after next, we will learn to conduct regression analysis in R before going into the fall break. 
\end{witemize}
