    "section": "Research Question and Data",
    "text": "Research Question and Data\nYou may choose any question and data, provided they meet the criteria outlined below.\n\nQuestion\nStart by identifying a topic that captivates your interest or curiosity. This could be inspired by a recent podcast you listened to or a news item that caught your attention. The key is to choose a subject that genuinely engages you, as this will make the research process more enjoyable and meaningful.\nFocus your research on a cause-effect question, rather than a predictive one. In other words, rather than undertaking a project aimed at “Using weather to predict sales,” you should investigate a question such as “How does weather affect sales?” While predictive questions are important, this project is designed to enhance your understanding of causality and the challenges involved in establishing it. Therefore, your question should concern the impact of one variable on another.\nFinally, ensure that your question is well-defined and feasible, meaning it should be clear and specific, and can be addressed within the limitations of time, resources, and the data available.\n\n\nVariables\nOnce your research question is set, the next step would be to identify the variables required to investigate it. For example, if your question is “How does weather affect sales?”, you need to decide how to define ‘weather’—are you focusing on temperature, rainfall, or other weather conditions? For this project, you are required to select a primary independent variable, a dependent variable, and at least two control variables.\n\nPrimary Independent Variable: This is the main variable you hypothesize as having an influence or effect on another. For instance, if you were studying the impact of weather on sales, temperature or rainfall would be your primary independent variable.\nDependent Variable: This is the variable affected by the independent variable. In the example of weather and sales, ‘sales’ would be the dependent variable.\nControl Variables: These are variables that affect both the dependent and the independent variable, potentially confounding our primary relationship of interest. For example, ‘month of sale’ would be a confounding variable as it affects both sales and weather conditions. For instance, people tend to buy more gifts during the holiday season when the weather is also colder. So we might observe higher sales during colder months, but this could be due to the holiday season rather than the weather. To account for such confounding effects, you will incorporate the control variables you select later in your analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart LR\n    X(Primary Independent Variable) --&gt; Y(Dependent Variable)\n    C(Control Variables) --&gt; X & Y\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDataset\nYou have the option to select an external dataset or choose one from the list of datasets I’ve compiled for this class. The compiled datasets are available in the Dropbox folder: Econ340 Datasets. Should you choose an external dataset, make sure it includes at least 100 observations and contains all the variables you plan to utilize. If you require assistance with formatting an external dataset, kindly email me at least a week in advance of your submission deadline. I would be more than happy to help you. See External Resources for some external data sources.\n\n\nThe Chicken and Egg Question\nDeciding whether to first select your question or choose a dataset can feel like the classic chicken and egg dilemma. A question is infeasible without available data, just as data lacks purpose without a compelling question. In my opinion, the best approach is to first identify an interesting question, then consider the variables you’ll need to explore it, and finally search for datasets that may include those variables.\nHowever, it’s not uncommon to encounter a situation where the data you need isn’t readily available. When faced with this hurdle, you’re prompted to reassess: Could you refine your original question based on the data you do have access to, or should you explore a different question altogether—one that aligns with measurable variables in the available data? This iterative approach underscores the flexible nature of research, where adjustments to the research question and the variables of interest may be necessary to accommodate the data you can actually obtain.",

    "text": "Structure and Content\n\nI. Introduction (under 1 page)\n\nClearly state the research question in a manner that is engaging and relevant to an average reader.\nTell us why your research question is interesting and important. \nProvide a brief and concise summary of your main results. People who do not have time to go through the entire paper should get the general idea and conclusion of the paper through the introduction section.\n\n\n\nII. Literature Review (under 1 page)\n\nReview the literature to identify existing studies on the topic that are related to your paper in some manner. For instance, you may cite a paper that uncovers similar findings in a different context, or papers that offer a counter view, or even reference papers that study a different but related question if insights from those papers and your paper, together, can help you make broader conclusions.\nThe literature review should ideally include more than two academic papers. You should look for papers on Google Scholar.\nCite sources using the APA (American Psychological Association) format and attach a reference list at the end of your write-up. Click here to learn more. \n\n\n\nIII. Descriptive Analysis (about 1-2 pages, including relevant figures and tables)\n\nMention and verbally describe the dataset you are using, your dependent variable, primary independent variable, and control variables. Remember to mention how the variables are named in your dataset. Mention if you constructed new variables or deleted observations. Also, note the number of observations in your data.\nPresent summary statistics for all your variables in a table. Comment on the averages of your variables and anything else you think is interesting or important. Be careful in properly describing the averages of your binary variables.\nPresent a graph showing the relationship between your dependent and primary independent variable. You should present a scatter plot if both of your variables are continuous. If any of the two variables is binary, use a bar plot. Summarize what you learn.\n\n\n\nIV. Empirical Strategy (about 1 page)\n\nOutline the empirical strategy and introduce the estimating regression equation. Note that you maybe running multiple specifications, some with a reduced set of control variables. In this section, specify the equation for the model that includes the largest number of variables.\nYour regression model should look something like: \\[ depvar = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1*indepvar + \\beta_2*control1 + \\beta_3*control2 + u \\] Here, \\(depvar, indepvar\\), etc. should be replaced with actual variable names from your dataset.\nHighlight how the above regression model can help answer your question. Provide an intuitive interpretation of the coefficient of the main independent variable, specifically linking it to the research hypothesis.\nJustify your choice of control variables by outlining plausible connections between the independent and control variables and their impact on the dependent variable.\n\n\n\nV. Results and Analysis (about 1-2 pages)\n\nIn one or more tables, present the results of your regression analysis. You should present the results without controls and then add controls, one by one, to see what happens to your main coefficient. With two controls, you will have three different specifications. If you have multiple control variables, feel free to add more than one control as you transition to the next specification. You can build on the following code to create this table in R:\n\nmodel1 &lt;- lm(depvar ~ indepvar, data)\nmodel2 &lt;- lm(depvar ~ indepvar + control1, data)\nmodel3 &lt;- lm(depvar ~ indepvar + control1 + control2, data)\nstargazer (model1, model2, model3, type=\"text\", keep.stat = c(\"n\",\"adj.rsq\"))\n\nInterpret the sign, the value, and the significance level of the coefficient on your primary independent variable across all specifications. Comment on how and why the coefficient changes or does not change as you add additional controls. \nComment on the coefficients on your control variables.\nInterpret the adjusted \\(R^2\\) of your regression models.\nExplain in detail what you can conclude from your regression results. How do they answer your research question? \nComment on whether you believe that the results you find are correlational or causal. Discuss whether there are other variables that are not in the dataset (or not in your regression) that could affect both the dependent variable and your primary independent variable. If so, mention these unobserved/omitted variables and explain how they can lead you to over or underestimate the true impact of your primary independent variable.\n\n\n\nVI. Conclusion (under 1 page)\n\nBegin by summarizing the key findings of your study. Based on this summary, directly address and answer your research question.\nExpand on how your research findings connect to broader implications. This could involve exploring potential avenues for future research prompted by your study’s results, discussing the implications your findings may have on policy-making, or situating your research within a wider context. It would also be great to revisit the initial motivation behind your research question mentioned in the introduction, during this discussion.\n\n\n\nReferences\nWrite down a References List using the APA format, where you cite the papers you referenced in the Literature Review section.\n\n\nAppendix (optional)\nIf you think that some of the tables and graphs you produced in the Descriptive Analyses section are not very useful considering your research question, drop them (and the related comments) from that section, and include them (with the related comments) in the Appendix.",

The course aims to take you through the steps involved in answering a research question using observational data. You will learn and implement statistical and econometric concepts vital to empirical research. You will select a question, locate data to answer it and use the tools we learn in this class to answer this question.\nThis course will involve hands-on work with data using R, a statistical software, both inside and outside the classroom. The tools learned in this class will be helpful regardless of whether your goal is to be a researcher, a consultant, run your own business, or work for a non-profit.\n\n\n\n\nLearning Goals\nUpon successful completion of this course, students will be able to discern valuable insights from datasets and communicate empirical findings effectively. In particular, you will\n\nDevelop a strong grasp of both the conceptual and practical aspects of various statistical and econometric tools.\nLearn to tidy, wrangle, manipulate, and visualize data using TidyVerse in R.\nBe able to compute descriptive statistics, perform regression analysis in R, and present results in a clear, elegant manner.\nGain the skill to effectively communicate empirical findings.\nDevelop an understanding of causality, including the ability to identify and articulate potential threats to causal inference\nGet an introduction to advanced topics at the forefront of economic research, such as quasi-experimental methods and machine learning.\n\n\n\n\n\nCourse Structure\nAll meetings for this course are expected to take place in a physical classroom. During class, in addition to my delivering the day’s topics via lecture slides, you will often be expected to engage in collaborative problem-solving with handouts, work on R programming exercises, and participate in class discussions. The course is designed to be interactive, and requires you to actively participate. Therefore, regular class attendance is especially important for you to suceed in this class.\nA significant portion of this class is focused on developing a research paper, which you can complete individually or with a classmate. You can either choose your own dataset or use one of the datasets that I have compiled for this class in the Econ340 Datasets Dropbox folder. You’ll begin the research project early in the semester, with assignments focused on formulating a question, selecting data, and conducting descriptive analysis. I’ll provide guidance and support throughout the semester and will schedule a mid-semester meeting to review your progress.\n\n\n\n\nCourse Material\nAll course materials—including lecture slides, handouts, notes for each topic—are available on the course website. These materials should generally be sufficient, and there is no mandatory textbook for this class. However, if you have a keen interest in the subject and seek additional references, the following options are great choices:\n\nStock J, Watson M. Introduction to Econometrics (3rd edition)\nHuntington-Klein, Nick. 2021. The Effect: An Introduction to Research Design and Causality https://theeffectbook.net/\nCunningham, Scott. Causal Inference: The Mixtape https://mixtape.scunning.com\n\n\n\n\n\nGrading Criteria\nYour course grade will be determined according to the following breakdown:\n\n\n\nComponent\n\n\nPoints\n\n\n\n\nActive Engagement\n\n\n10\n\n\n\n\nProblem Sets\n\n\n20\n\n\n\n\nResearch Paper: Interim Submissions\n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\nResearch Paper: Final Submission\n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\nMidterm Exam\n\n\n20\n\n\n\n\nFinal Exam\n\n\n20"
