The course aims to take you through the steps involved in answering a research question using observational data. You will learn and implement statistical and econometric concepts vital to empirical research. You will select a question, locate data to answer it and use the tools we learn in this class to answer this question.\nThis course will involve hands-on work with data using R, a statistical software, both inside and outside the classroom. The tools learned in this class will be helpful regardless of whether your goal is to be a researcher, a consultant, run your own business, or work for a non-profit.\nSee the syllabus for more details.\n\n\nLecture Material\n\nModule I: Describing Data\nLecture Notes\n\nLecture 1: Introduction; Summation Notation (slides, class handout)\nLecture 2: Distribution, Mean, Median, Percentiles (slides, class handout)\nLecture 3: Variance, Standard Deviation, Z-Score (slides, class handout)\nLecture 4: Covariance and Correlation (slides, class handout)\nLecture 5: Research Questions and Data (slides)\n\n\n\nModule II: Coding in R\n\nLecture 6: Getting Started with R (slides)\nLecture 7: Data Analysis in R (slides)\nLecture 8: Data Analysis in R (slides)\n\n\n\nModule III: Random Variables\nLecture Notes\n\nLecture 9: Distribution, Expectation, Variance (slides, class handout)\nLecture 10: Normal Distribution, Z-Score (slides, class handout)\nLecture 11: Independence and Correlation (slides, class handout)\n\n\n\nModule IV: Sampling and Estimation\nLecture Notes\n\nLecture 12: Good Estimators, Sample Mean Distribution (slides, class handout)\nLecture 13: Confidence Intervals (slides, class handout)\nLecture 14: Hypothesis Testing and P-Values (slides, class handout)\n\n\n\nModule V: Linear Regression\nNotes for Lectures 15-17\n\nLecture 15: Ordinary Least Squares (OLS); R-Squared (slides, class handout)\nLecture 16: Prediction vs. Causal Inference (slides)\nLecture 17: Inference (p-values, t-stats, confidence intervals) (slides, class handout)\nLecture 18: Omitted Variable Bias; Multiple Regression (slides, class handout, lecture notes I & II)\nLecture 19: Categorical Variables; Interaction Terms (slides, class handout, lecture notes)\nLecture 20: Quadratic and Log Functional Forms (slides, class handout, lecture notes)\nLecture 21: Regression Analysis in R (slides)\nLecture 22: Regression Analysis in R (slides)\n\n\n\nModule VI: Advanced Topics\n\nLecture 23: Experiments and Quasi-Experimental Methods (slides)\nLecture 24: Differences-in-Differences (slides)\nLecture 25: Big Data and Machine Learning (slides)\n\n\n\n\nResearch Paper\nOverview\nAs a part of this class, you will write an empirical research paper using R in groups of 2-3 students. You will pick a question and a dataset and use the tools from this class to answer your question. Over the semester, you will need to meet the following milestones:\n\nSep 26: First submission (5%)\nOct 31: Second submission (10%)\nDec 05: Final submission (15%)\n\nThe goal of the first submission is to make you pick your data and question. For the second submission, you will be performing preliminary data analysis. The final paper will be 7 to 10 pages and will thoroughly discuss all the analyses you performed. The paper should demonstrate your writing ability and ability to perform and interpret statistical analyses correctly.\nThe following links provide detailed instructions for each submission:\n\nFirst submission (instructions, template, example)\nSecond submission (instructions, example)\nFinal submission (instructions)\n\nQuestions and Data\nYou can pick any question and data as long as it meets the requirements specified in Submission 1. I have also compiled a set of datasets for you to use for your research projects. You can find these in the Dropbox folder: Econ340 Datasets. Let me know if you have any issues accessing the folder. Here is a list of the datasets in the Dropbox folder. You can pick a dataset from the Dropbox folder or use an external one. Below are some external sources of data. \nExternal Data Sources\n\nThe US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) maintains lots of series.  A notable one is the Local Unemployment Area Statistics (LUAS) which provides the unemployment rate for US metropolitan areas.\nThe US Bureau of Economic Analysis also maintains lots of series. (You can look for data by Topic or by Place)\nWorld Bank provides large datasets across countries, including the World Development Indicators (WDI) database and the Global Financial Development Database (GFDD). \nIPUMS is your one-stop shop for downloading US (and international) microdata, such as from the Current Population Survey (CPS), American Community Survey (ACS), American Time-Use Survey (ATUS), etc.\nTwo leading US longitudinal datasets are the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) and National Longitudinal Surveys (NLSY).\nCounty Business Patterns (CBP) data contains the number of establishments and employment for different industries in each US county.\nFRED at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis maintains numerous data series on macroeconomic variables (mostly time series).\nOpportunity Insights Data Library has some datasets at the county or commuting zone level with variables related to economic mobility. \nMore county-level data is available from USDA ERS. \nCheck out FiveThirtyEight for sports and election data.\nIf you are looking for more data, check out AEA’s Compiled Data Sources (Check this link too).\n\nFinally, if you need some inspiration to come up with a research question, here are some links to get you thinking:\n\nFreakonomics Radio\nAEA Research Digest\nNBER Research News\nVoxEU\nIMF Blog\n\nNewspapers and other news outlets are also good sources to learn about current issues.\n\n\nProblem Sets\n\nProblem Set 1\nProblem Set 2 (Download zippped folder with datasets and R Code to complete.)\nProblem Set 3\nProblem Set 4\n\n\n\nExams Related Material\n\nMidterm\n\nSample Exam\nSample Exam Solutions\nStudy Guide\nFormula Sheet\n\nFinal\n\nSample Exam\nSample Exam Solutions\nStudy Guide\nSample Questions for Module VI\n\n\nBack to Top"
