The course aims to take you through the steps involved in answering a research question using observational data. You will learn and implement statistical and econometric concepts vital to empirical research. You will select a question, locate data to answer it and use the tools we learn in this class to answer this question.\nThis course will involve hands-on work with data using R, a statistical software, both inside and outside the classroom. The tools learned in this class will be helpful regardless of whether your goal is to be a researcher, a consultant, run your own business, or work for a non-profit.\n\n\n\n\nLearning Goals\nUpon successful completion of this course, students will be able to discern valuable insights from datasets and communicate empirical findings effectively. In particular, you will\n\nDevelop a strong grasp of both the conceptual and practical aspects of various statistical and econometric tools.\nLearn to tidy, wrangle, manipulate, and visualize data using TidyVerse in R.\nBe able to compute descriptive statistics, perform regression analysis in R, and present results in a clear, elegant manner.\nGain the skill to effectively communicate empirical findings.\nDevelop an understanding of causality, including the ability to identify and articulate potential threats to causal inference\nGet an introduction to advanced topics at the forefront of economic research, such as quasi-experimental methods and machine learning.\n\n\n\n\n\nCourse Structure\nAll meetings for this are anticipated to take place in a physical classroom setting. During our class sessions, I use lecture slides to deliver the day’s topics, and we frequently engage in collaborative problem-solving using handouts, practical work in R, or participate in class discussions. The course is designed to be interactive, and requires you to actively participate. Therefore, regular class attendance is especially important for you to suceed in this class.\nA substantial portion of this class centers around the development of a research paper. You have the freedom to choose your dataset or you can utilize one of the datasets that I have compiled for this class in the Econ340 Datasets Dropbox folder. You will start working on the research project early in the semester with assignments focused on coming up with a question, selecting data, and conducting descriptive analysis. I will provide guidance and support as you progress through the semester, and also schedule a mid-semester meeting to evaluate your progress.\n\n\n\n\nCourse Material\nAll course materials—including lecture slides, handouts, notes for each topic—are available on the course website. These materials should generally be sufficient, and there is no mandatory textbook for this class. However, if you have a keen interest in the subject and seek additional references, the following options are great choices:\n\nStock J, Watson M.

    "text": "Overview\nAs a part of this class, you will write an empirical research paper. You will pick a question and a dataset and use the tools from this class to answer your question. Over the semester, you will need to meet the following milestones:\n\nSep 26: First submission (5%)\nOct 31: Second submission (10%)\nDec 05: Final submission (15%)\n\nThe goal of the first submission is to make you pick your data and question. For the second submission, you will be performing preliminary data analysis. The final paper will be 7 to 10 pages and will thoroughly discuss all the analyses you performed. The paper should demonstrate your writing ability and ability to perform and interpret statistical analyses correctly.\nThe following links provide detailed instructions for each submission:\n\nFirst submission (instructions, template, example)\nSecond submission (instructions, example)\nFinal submission (instructions)\n\n\n\nQuestions and Data\nYou can pick any question and data as long as it meets the requirements specified in Submission 1. I have also compiled a set of datasets for you to use for your research projects. You can find these in the Dropbox folder: Econ340 Datasets. Let me know if you have any issues accessing the folder. Here is a list of the datasets in the Dropbox folder. You can pick a dataset from the Dropbox folder or use an external one. Below are some external sources of data. \n\n\nExternal Data Sources\n\nThe US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) maintains lots of series.  A notable one is the Local Unemployment Area Statistics (LUAS) which provides the unemployment rate for US metropolitan areas.\nThe US Bureau of Economic Analysis also maintains lots of series. (You can look for data by Topic or by Place)\nWorld Bank provides large datasets across countries, including the World Development Indicators (WDI) database and the Global Financial Development Database (GFDD). \nIPUMS is your one-stop shop for downloading US (and international) microdata, such as from the Current Population Survey (CPS), American Community Survey (ACS), American Time-Use Survey (ATUS), etc.\nTwo leading US longitudinal datasets are the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) and National Longitudinal Surveys (NLSY).\nCounty Business Patterns (CBP) data contains the number of establishments and employment for different industries in each US county.\nFRED at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis maintains numerous data series on macroeconomic variables (mostly time series).\nOpportunity Insights Data Library has some datasets at the county or commuting zone level with variables related to economic mobility. \nMore county-level data is available from USDA ERS. \nCheck out FiveThirtyEight for sports and election data.\nIf you are looking for more data, check out AEA’s Compiled Data Sources (Check this link too).\n\nFinally, if you need some inspiration to come up with a research question, here are some links to get you thinking:\n\nFreakonomics Radio\nAEA Research Digest\nNBER Research News\nVoxEU\nIMF Blog\n\nNewspapers and other news outlets are also good sources to learn about current issues."
