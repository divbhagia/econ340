\section*{Instruction Modality}
All meetings (including the midterm and final exam) for this course are expected to be held in person. You should inform me in advance if you cannot attend the class in any given week. If you test positive or are exposed to Covid, please report it using the \href{https://coronavirus.fullerton.edu/report-covid-19-case-or-exposure/}{CSUF COVID-19 Self Reporting Form}. If we must move the classes online due to unforeseen circumstances, we will meet on \href{https://fullerton.zoom.us/j/81895171931}{Zoom}.

\section*{Course Communication}
All course announcements and individual emails are sent through Canvas, which only uses CSUF email accounts. Therefore, you MUST check your CSUF email regularly (several times a week) for the course duration.

\section*{Conduct in the Classroom}
Use of phones, laptops, or other digital devices is not allowed during the lecture except when explicitly instructed to use one. Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) conducted at West Point show that in-class computer use inhibits learning. Here is a \href{https://oema.army.mil/pub/2017_Carter_Greenberg_Walker_Computer_Usage_RCT_USMA.pdf}{link} to the paper. Tablets used for taking notes that remain flat on the desk are allowed.

\section*{Course Catalog Description}
Basics of applied economic research. How to access existing economic knowledge, locate and compile economic data, and analyze economic problems using theory and quantitative methods.

\section*{Course Prerequisites}
ECON 201, ECON 202, ISDS 361A

\section*{Course Materials}
All course materials---including lecture slides, handouts, notes for each topicâ€”are available on the course website. These materials should generally be sufficient, and there is no mandatory textbook for this class. However, if you have a keen interest in the subject and seek additional references, the following options are excellent choices:

\begin{itemize}
\item Stock J, Watson M. Introduction to Econometrics (3rd edition) 
\item Huntington-Klein, Nick. 2021. The Effect: An Introduction to Research Design and Causality. \href{https://theeffectbook.net/}{https://theeffectbook.net/}
\item Cunningham, Scott. Causal Inference: The Mixtape. \href{https://mixtape.scunning.com/}{https://mixtape.scunning.com/}
\end{itemize}

\section*{Software}
You are required to use $\mathrm{R}$ for this course. $\mathrm{R}$ is a free software package for statistics and is available for download \href{https://www.r-project.org}{here}. After installing $\mathrm{R}$, you should also install \href{https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/}{$\mathrm{R}$ Studio}, which provides a graphical interface for $\mathrm{R}$.

\section*{Course Overview}
This course covers the basics of conducting quantitative economic research. The course aims to take you through the steps involved in answering a research question using observational data. You will learn and implement statistical and econometric concepts vital to empirical research. You will select a question, locate data to answer it and use the tools we learn in this class to answer this question.

This course will involve hands-on work with data using $\mathrm{R}$, a statistical software, both inside and outside the classroom. The tools learned in this class will be helpful regardless of whether your goal is to be a researcher, a consultant, run your own business, or work for a non-profit.

\section*{Learning Goals}
Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to discern valuable insights from datasets and communicate empirical findings effectively. In particular, you will:
\begin{enumerate}
\itemsep0em 
  \item Develop a strong grasp of both the conceptual and practical aspects of various statistical and econometric tools.
  \item Learn to tidy, wrangle, manipulate, and visualize data using TidyVerse in $\mathrm{R}$.
  \item Be able to compute descriptive statistics, perform regression analysis in R, and present results in a clear, elegant manner.
  \item Gain the skill to effectively communicate empirical findings.
  \item Develop an understanding of causality, including the ability to identify and articulate potential threats to causal inference
  \item Get an introduction to advanced topics at the forefront of economic research, such as quasi-experimental methods and machine learning.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Grading Criteria}

Plus/minus grading will be used in this course. You are guaranteed at least the following grade if your weighted average course score falls within the specified range. A curve may be applied to the final grade.

\begin{center}
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.75\textwidth}
\begin{tabular}{|ccc|}
\hline
Grade & \multicolumn{2}{c|}{Range} \\
$\mathrm{A}+$ & $100 \%$ & to $97 \%$ \\
$\mathrm{~A}$ & $<97 \%$ & to $93 \%$ \\
$\mathrm{~A}-$ & $<93 \%$ & to $90 \%$ \\
$\mathrm{~B}+$ & $<90 \%$ & to $87 \%$ \\
$\mathrm{~B}$ & $<87 \%$ & to $84 \%$ \\
$\mathrm{~B}-$ & $<84 \%$ & to $80 \%$ \\
$\mathrm{C}+$ & $<80 \%$ & to $77 \%$ \\

\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{minipage}
\end{center} 

Your course grade will be determined according to the following breakdown:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabularx}{0.65\textwidth}{Xr}
\hline
Active Engagement & 10 \\
Problem Sets & 20 \\
Research Paper: Interim Submissions & 15 \\
Research Paper: Final Submission & 15 \\
Midterm & 20 \\
Final Exam & 20 \\
\hline
Total & 100 \\
\hline
\end{tabularx}
\end{center}

\subsection*{Active Engagement}
Active engagement is crucial for success in this class. Please participate in class discussions and ask questions when topics need clarification. You can only do these things if you are in class, so please attend. Attendance will be taken occasionally. Participating in meetings to receive feedback on the research project is also considered active engagement. The active engagement grade also includes points from peer review from your research partners conducted at the end of the semester.

\subsection*{Problem Sets}
There will be four problem sets worth 5 points each over the semester. Feel free to seek help from your peers, but each person must submit their answers on Canvas.

\subsection*{Research Paper: Interim and Final Submissions}
One of the main objectives of this class is to write a research paper using the tools you learn in this class. You can complete this project alone or with a classmate. In addition to the final submission of the research paper, you are also required to submit two progress reports. The first submission is worth 5 points, and the second submission is worth 10 points. The final submission is worth 15 points. Details on what is expected of the interim submissions and the final research paper are posted on the course website. I will also guide you through the process of selecting your question and data.

\subsection*{Exams}
There will be a midterm and a final. The exams will be mostly short answer problems that cover the methods and material presented in the course. The final exam is not cumulative. Both exams will be in-person.
